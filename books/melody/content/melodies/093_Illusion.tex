        }{The melody weaves between chromatic half-steps and unexpected leaps, creating sonic mirages that dissolve as quickly as they form. Each phrase questions reality, with sharp dissonances melting into familiar tones, embodying how illusions shimmer between truth and deception in our perception.}
