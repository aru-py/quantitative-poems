\poem{Pain}{Pain = \frac{I \cdot T^{\alpha}}{R \cdot e^{-A}}}{\item $I$: \index{Intensity}\textit{Intensity}. The raw magnitude of the triggering event or stimulus, representing the initial force that disrupts equilibrium and challenges one's capacity to maintain stability.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration over which suffering persists, amplified by the exponential nature of prolonged exposure that can either deepen wounds or catalyze profound transformation.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The innate and developed capacity to withstand, adapt, and recover from adversity, serving as a protective denominator that diminishes pain's overwhelming power.
\item $A$: \index{Acceptance}\textit{Acceptance}. The degree of surrender and peace made with suffering's presence, exponentially reducing pain's grip through the transformative power of embracing rather than resisting.}{This equation reveals pain as the interplay between external forces and internal fortitude. Intensity and time amplify suffering exponentially, while resilience acts as a shield dividing its impact. Acceptance transforms pain through exponential healing, showing that our relationship with suffering—not suffering itself—determines its ultimate power over us.}
