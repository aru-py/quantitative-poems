\poem{Healing}{Healing = \frac{T \cdot R^2 \cdot e^{-P/S}}{1 + C}}{\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The essential dimension through which all healing unfolds, representing both the duration of recovery and the patient persistence required for wounds to close.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The inner strength and adaptive capacity that enables one to bounce back from adversity, squared to show its compounding effect on recovery processes.
\item $P$: \index{Pain}\textit{Pain}. The intensity of suffering, trauma, or distress that must be processed and integrated, appearing in the exponential to show how it initially inhibits healing.
\item $S$: \index{Support}\textit{Support}. The network of care, love, and assistance from others that provides the foundation for recovery, acting as a buffer against pain's destructive force.
\item $C$: \index{Cynicism}\textit{Cynicism}. The protective but limiting skepticism and emotional walls built from past hurts, which can slow healing by preventing openness to recovery and growth.}{This equation reveals healing as a delicate dance between time's patient passage and resilience's squared strength, modulated by an exponential decay of pain softened by support. Like a wound that closes fastest when tended with care, healing accelerates when our inner fortitude meets external love, while cynicism's denominator reminds us that closed hearts heal more slowly than open ones.}
