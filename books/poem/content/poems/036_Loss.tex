\poem{Loss}{Loss = \frac{A \cdot T^2 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}}{R + 1}}{\item $A$: \index{Attachment}\textit{Attachment}. The depth of emotional bond and connection formed with a person, place, or experience, determining the foundation upon which loss builds its impact.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration of meaningful connection squared, representing how shared moments compound exponentially to deepen the significance of what is lost.
\item $\lambda$: \index{Lambda}\textit{Lambda}. The natural decay constant of grief, representing how the acute intensity of loss gradually diminishes as healing processes unfold over time.
\item $t$: \index{Duration}\textit{Duration}. The elapsed time since the moment of loss occurred, serving as the temporal dimension through which grief transforms and evolves into acceptance.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The accumulated strength from previous experiences of overcoming adversity, acting as a protective factor that helps moderate the devastating impact of loss.}{This equation reveals loss as a complex interplay between connection and time. Attachment and squared time create the magnitude of what we lose - deeper bonds over longer periods generate exponential impact. The exponential decay shows how acute grief naturally softens, while resilience in the denominator demonstrates how our capacity to endure moderates loss's weight, teaching us that healing is both inevitable and proportional to our inner strength.}
