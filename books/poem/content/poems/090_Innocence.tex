\poem{Innocence}{Innocence = \frac{W \cdot P^2}{e^{E \cdot T}}}{\item $W$: \index{Wonder}\textit{Wonder}. The capacity for awe and amazement at the world's beauty and mystery, driving curiosity and maintaining childlike fascination with life's simple pleasures and complexities.
\item $P$: \index{Purity}\textit{Purity}. The untarnished quality of thoughts, intentions, and actions, free from malice or ulterior motives, representing the clarity of an uncorrupted heart and mind.
\item $E$: \index{Experience}\textit{Experience}. The accumulated knowledge gained through living, including exposure to pain, betrayal, and the harsh realities of existence that gradually erode innocence over time.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The relentless passage of moments that inevitably brings encounters with life's complexities, serving as the vehicle through which experience accumulates and innocence fades.}{This equation reveals innocence as a delicate equilibrium between wonder and purity against the exponential erosion of time and experience. Wonder and purity multiply and strengthen each other, creating moments of pure joy and untainted perception. Yet experience and time form an exponential decay function, showing how even small exposures to life's harsh realities compound rapidly, making innocence increasingly fragile and precious as we age.}
