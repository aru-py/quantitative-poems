\poem{Fear}{Fear = \frac{T \cdot U^2}{R \cdot e^{-C}}}{\item $T$: \index{Threat}\textit{Threat}. The perceived magnitude of danger or harm, whether real or imagined, that triggers our survival instincts and amplifies our emotional response to situations.
\item $U$: \index{Uncertainty}\textit{Uncertainty}. The degree of unpredictability in a situation, squared to show how ambiguity exponentially increases fear as our minds struggle to predict and control outcomes.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. Our psychological strength and adaptive capacity to cope with challenges, acting as a protective factor that diminishes fear's overwhelming power over our decisions.
\item $C$: \index{Courage}\textit{Courage}. The willingness to face danger or difficulty despite fear, appearing as a negative exponent to show how bravery exponentially reduces fear's grip on our hearts.}{This equation reveals fear as the intersection of threat and uncertainty, amplified by our inability to predict outcomes. When resilience weakens and courage diminishes, fear grows exponentially, paralyzing action. Yet courage acts as an exponential force - even small acts of bravery dramatically reduce fear's power, showing that facing our fears transforms them from insurmountable mountains into manageable hills.}
