\poem{Comfort}{Comfort = \frac{S \cdot A^2 \cdot e^{-T}}{P + R}}{\item $S$: \index{Safety}\textit{Safety}. The foundational security we feel in our environment, relationships, and circumstances, providing the bedrock upon which all other comfort builds.
\item $A$: \index{Acceptance}\textit{Acceptance}. The degree to which we feel embraced and valued for who we truly are, squared because self-acceptance amplifies external acceptance exponentially.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration of stress or discomfort endured, where the exponential decay shows how comfort naturally returns as difficult moments fade into memory.
\item $P$: \index{Pain}\textit{Pain}. Physical, emotional, or psychological suffering that acts as a barrier to comfort, requiring acknowledgment and healing to diminish its impact on wellbeing.
\item $R$: \index{Resistance}\textit{Resistance}. Our internal struggle against accepting present circumstances, creating tension that prevents us from finding peace and ease in the current moment.}{This equation reveals comfort as an elegant dance between nurturing forces and diminishing barriers. Safety and acceptance work together, with acceptance's squared power showing how self-love amplifies all external warmth. Time's exponential decay reminds us that even deepest sorrows soften, while pain and resistance in the denominator show how releasing struggle opens pathways to profound peace and contentment.}
