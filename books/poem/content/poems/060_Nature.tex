\poem{Nature}{Nature = \frac{B \cdot e^{-T/\tau}}{1 + A^2}}{\item $B$: \index{Biodiversity}\textit{Biodiversity}. The rich tapestry of life forms in an ecosystem, multiplying harmony through the intricate web of relationships between species, plants, and environmental elements.
\item $T$: \index{Technology}\textit{Technology}. The degree of artificial intervention and digital immersion in daily life, which exponentially diminishes our natural connection as it increases beyond sustainable levels.
\item $\tau$: \index{Timescale}\textit{Timescale}. The natural rhythm of seasonal cycles and biological processes, serving as the fundamental tempo that governs all life and against which human activity is measured.
\item $A$: \index{Alienation}\textit{Alienation}. The psychological distance and disconnection from natural environments, amplified by urban living and indoor lifestyles, creating barriers to ecological awareness.}{This equation reveals how human harmony with nature emerges through biodiversity's richness, tempered by technology's exponential interference with natural timescales, while alienation creates quadratic resistance to our ecological connection.}
