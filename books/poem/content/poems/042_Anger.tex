\poem{Anger}{Anger = \frac{T \cdot P^2}{R \cdot e^{-S}}}{\item $T$: \index{Triggers}\textit{Triggers}. The accumulated provocations and injustices that ignite our emotional response, representing the external stimuli that challenge our sense of fairness and control.
\item $P$: \index{Pain}\textit{Pain}. The underlying hurt and wounded vulnerability that fuels our rage, squared because emotional pain compounds exponentially when left unaddressed and unhealed.
\item $R$: \index{Restraint}\textit{Restraint}. Our capacity for emotional regulation and self-control, representing the wisdom and discipline that can temper our fiery responses and guide us toward constructive action.
\item $S$: \index{Support}\textit{Support}. The strength we draw from relationships, community, and inner resources, appearing as a negative exponent because support exponentially diminishes anger's destructive power.}{This equation reveals anger as a complex interplay of triggers and pain amplified by our wounds, yet tempered by restraint and exponentially softened by support. Pain squares because unhealed hurt compounds, while support appears as a negative exponent, showing how connection dissolves rage. The mathematics mirrors life: anger grows when we feel alone and diminishes when we feel held.}
