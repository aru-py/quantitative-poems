\poem{Anxiety}{Anxiety = \frac{U \cdot T^2}{C \cdot e^{-R}}}{\item $U$: \index{Uncertainty}\textit{Uncertainty}. The unknown variables in life's equation, representing all the unpredictable outcomes and uncontrollable circumstances that fuel our deepest worries.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The temporal dimension that amplifies anxiety quadratically, as anticipation builds exponentially with each passing moment before uncertain events.
\item $C$: \index{Control}\textit{Control}. Our perceived ability to influence outcomes and shape our destiny, serving as a stabilizing denominator that reduces anxiety when we feel empowered.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The exponential factor of inner strength and emotional recovery capacity that grows stronger through experience, naturally dampening anxiety's grip.}{This equation reveals anxiety as uncertainty amplified by time's quadratic pressure, divided by our sense of control and exponentially moderated by resilience. As uncertainty grows and time stretches toward unknown outcomes, anxiety intensifies dramatically. Yet when we cultivate control over our responses and build resilience through experience, anxiety's power diminishes exponentially, showing that inner strength is our most powerful mathematical ally against life's uncertainties.}
