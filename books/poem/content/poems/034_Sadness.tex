\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration since the triggering event occurred, representing how recent wounds cut deeper while distant memories may still ache with persistent longing.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The individual's capacity for emotional recovery and adaptation, acting as a healing force that gradually diminishes the exponential weight of sadness over time.
\item $H$: \index{Hope}\textit{Hope}. The sustaining belief in future possibilities and meaning, serving as a protective denominator that prevents sadness from overwhelming the soul completely.}{This equation reveals sadness as a natural response to loss, amplified by time's immediate sting yet softened by resilience's exponential healing. Hope acts as our emotional foundation, ensuring that even in deepest sorrow, we remain anchored to possibility and renewal.}
