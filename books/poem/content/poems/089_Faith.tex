\poem{Faith}{Faith = \frac{B \cdot H^{\alpha}}{U + e^{-T}}}{\item $B$: \index{Belief}\textit{Belief}. The foundational conviction in principles, values, or truths that forms the bedrock of our worldview and guides our decisions through life's complexities.
\item $H$: \index{Hope}\textit{Hope}. The luminous expectation of positive outcomes that sustains us through adversity, raised to the power of alpha to reflect its exponential impact on faith.
\item $U$: \index{Uncertainty}\textit{Uncertainty}. The accumulated weight of doubt, ambiguity, and unknown variables that challenge our convictions and create resistance to unwavering belief.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The temporal dimension through which faith either strengthens through experience or weakens through trials, appearing as negative exponent showing doubt's decay.}{This equation reveals faith as the sacred mathematics of the human spirit. Belief and hope multiply in the numerator, with hope's exponential nature reflecting how even small sparks can ignite transformative conviction. Time appears as a negative exponent in the denominator, showing how persistent doubt naturally diminishes as we journey through life's experiences. Uncertainty acts as a constant denominator, acknowledging that faith must always coexist with the unknown, yet the equation demonstrates that strong belief and enduring hope can overcome even the greatest uncertainties.}
