\poem{Friendship}{Friendship = \frac{T \cdot S \cdot \ln(E+1)}{R^2}}{\item $T$: \index{Trust}\textit{Trust}. The foundational confidence and reliability between friends, built through consistent actions and vulnerability, serving as the cornerstone of authentic connection.
\item $S$: \index{Shared}\textit{Shared}. Common experiences, values, and memories that create mutual understanding and emotional resonance, strengthening the fabric of friendship through unity.
\item $E$: \index{Empathy}\textit{Empathy}. The ability to understand and share another's feelings, creating emotional bridges that deepen connection and foster compassionate understanding between souls.
\item $R$: \index{Resentment}\textit{Resentment}. Accumulated grievances and unresolved conflicts that create distance and barriers, acting as divisive forces that weaken friendship bonds when left unaddressed.}{This equation reveals friendship as trust and shared experiences amplified by the natural growth of empathy, all diminished by the square of resentment. The logarithmic nature of empathy shows how understanding grows gradually but steadily, while resentment's squared effect demonstrates how small grudges can exponentially damage bonds. True friendship flourishes when we nurture trust and shared moments while actively minimizing the corrosive power of unresolved conflicts.}
