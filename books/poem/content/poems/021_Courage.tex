\poem{Courage}{Courage = \frac{V \cdot P^{\sin(\theta)}}{F \cdot e^{-R}}}{\item $V$: \index{Values}\textit{Values}. Core principles and moral convictions that guide decision-making, providing the foundation and motivation for courageous action when circumstances challenge our beliefs.
\item $P$: \index{Purpose}\textit{Purpose}. The meaningful reason or driving force behind one's actions, amplified by the angle of perspective, giving direction and intensity to courageous endeavors.
\item $F$: \index{Fear}\textit{Fear}. Emotional response to perceived threats or uncertainty that acts as a natural inhibitor to action, requiring courage to overcome and transform into wisdom.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The capacity to recover from setbacks and adapt to challenges, which exponentially reduces the impact of fear through accumulated strength and experience.}{This equation reveals courage as the beautiful interplay between our deepest convictions and our human vulnerabilities. Values and purpose unite in the numerator, with purpose raised to the sine of our perspective angle, showing how our viewpoint shapes courage's intensity. Fear divides our courage, yet resilience exponentially diminishes fear's power. As we build resilience through life's trials, courage flows more freely, allowing our values and purpose to shine through even the darkest moments of uncertainty.}
