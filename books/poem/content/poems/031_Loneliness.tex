\poem{Loneliness}{Loneliness = \frac{I^2 \cdot e^{-S}}{C \cdot \ln(M + 1)}}{\item $I$: \index{Isolation}\textit{Isolation}. The physical and emotional distance from others, squared to reflect how isolation compounds exponentially when we withdraw from social connections.
\item $S$: \index{Support}\textit{Support}. The quality and strength of one's social network and emotional resources, appearing as a negative exponent to show how support diminishes loneliness exponentially.
\item $C$: \index{Connection}\textit{Connection}. The depth and authenticity of relationships and bonds with others, acting as a protective denominator that reduces loneliness through genuine human intimacy.
\item $M$: \index{Meaning}\textit{Meaning}. The sense of purpose and significance one finds in life and relationships, where the logarithmic function reflects how meaning grows slowly but profoundly.}{This equation reveals loneliness as isolation squared, amplified by the absence of support, yet diminished by authentic connection and life's meaning. The exponential decay of support shows how even small increases in emotional resources dramatically reduce loneliness, while the logarithmic nature of meaning reflects how purpose develops gradually but provides enduring protection against isolation's crushing weight.}
