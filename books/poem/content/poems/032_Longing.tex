\poem{Longing}{Longing = \frac{D \cdot M \cdot e^{-T/\tau}}{A + R}}{\item $D$: \index{Distance}\textit{Distance}. The physical, emotional, or temporal separation between ourselves and what we desire most, creating the essential void that feeds our yearning.
\item $M$: \index{Memory}\textit{Memory}. The vivid recollections and imagined possibilities that keep our desires alive, painting what we lack in colors more beautiful than reality.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The relentless passage of moments that can either intensify longing through prolonged separation or gradually diminish it through acceptance.
\item $A$: \index{Acceptance}\textit{Acceptance}. The gradual peace that comes with embracing what is rather than lamenting what isn't, serving as longing's gentle but persistent counterforce.
\item $R$: \index{Resolution}\textit{Resolution}. The active pursuit of closure or fulfillment that transforms yearning into action, diminishing longing through purposeful engagement with reality.}{This equation reveals longing as an exponential dance between desire and time. Distance and memory multiply to create the raw material of yearning, while time's exponential decay suggests that even the deepest longing naturally softens. Yet acceptance and resolution work as denominators, showing how inner peace and purposeful action can transform our aching into wisdom, making space for new forms of love.}
