\poem{Contentment}{Contentment = \frac{G \cdot A^2}{e^{D \cdot t} + R}}{\item $G$: \index{Gratitude}\textit{Gratitude}. The profound appreciation for what we possess, multiplying contentment by transforming ordinary moments into treasures of recognition and thankfulness.
\item $A$: \index{Acceptance}\textit{Acceptance}. The wisdom to embrace reality as it unfolds, squared to reflect its compounding power in creating peace through surrendering resistance to circumstances.
\item $D$: \index{Desire}\textit{Desire}. The intensity of wanting what we lack, exponentially growing with time to create restlessness that diminishes our capacity for present-moment satisfaction.
\item $R$: \index{Regret}\textit{Regret}. The weight of past decisions and missed opportunities that anchors us in sorrow, forming a constant denominator that reduces our ability to find peace.}{This equation reveals contentment as a delicate dance between appreciation and acceptance, divided by the exponential growth of unfulfilled desires and the persistent weight of regret. Gratitude multiplies our capacity for joy, while acceptance squares this effect through wisdom. Yet desire grows exponentially with time, and regret forms an unyielding foundation of discontent, showing how true serenity emerges only when we cultivate thankfulness and embrace what is.}
