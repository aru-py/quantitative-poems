\item $C$: \index{Corruption}\textit{Corruption}. The moral decay and compromise of principles that diminishes honor, representing the temptations and ethical shortcuts that erode character over time.
\item $T$: \index{Temptation}\textit{Temptation}.

Like a lighthouse cutting through darkness, honor emerges when principled deeds compound with selfless devotion, yet remains forever challenged by the gravitational pull of corruption and temptation that seek to diminish its luminous power.}
