\poem{Beauty}{Beauty = \frac{S \cdot H^{\phi}}{e^{C} + T}}{\item $S$: \index{Symmetry}\textit{Symmetry}. The mathematical balance and proportion found in forms, faces, and nature that creates an instinctive sense of visual harmony and pleasing arrangement.
\item $H$: \index{Harmony}\textit{Harmony}. The unified coherence between elements, colors, sounds, or emotions that creates a sense of completeness and resonates deeply within the observer's soul.
\item $C$: \index{Cynicism}\textit{Cynicism}. The accumulated skepticism and jadedness that builds barriers to appreciation, creating resistance to recognizing beauty in both obvious and subtle forms.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The temporal dimension that both reveals deeper beauty through contemplation and can diminish initial impressions through familiarity and changing perspectives.}{This equation reveals beauty as an exponential dance between harmony and symmetry, elevated by the golden ratio Ï†, yet tempered by our protective cynicism and the passage of time. Symmetry provides the foundation while harmony amplifies beauty's power exponentially. However, accumulated cynicism creates exponential resistance, and time adds complexity - sometimes deepening appreciation, sometimes dulling wonder. The mathematics shows that beauty flourishes when we maintain openness and allow harmonious elements to resonate within us.}
