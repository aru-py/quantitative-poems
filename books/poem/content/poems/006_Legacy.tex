\poem{Legacy}{Legacy = \frac{I \cdot A^t \cdot e^{-\lambda t}}{M}}{\item $I$: \index{Impact}\textit{Impact}. The initial magnitude of positive change created through meaningful actions, decisions, and contributions that touch lives and transform communities.
\item $A$: \index{Authenticity}\textit{Authenticity}. The degree to which one's actions align with core values and genuine self, amplifying legacy through sincere purpose rather than superficial achievement.
\item $t$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration over which authentic actions compound and multiply, allowing small consistent efforts to grow into transformative generational influence.
\item $M$: \index{Mortality}\textit{Mortality}. The finite nature of human existence that paradoxically gives urgency and meaning to legacy-building, making each moment of impact more precious and significant.}{This equation reveals legacy as impact amplified by authentic action over time, tempered by mortality's natural decay. Initial impact multiplies exponentially through genuine authenticity raised to the power of time, while the exponential decay function represents how memories fade. Yet mortality in the denominator shows that our finite nature actually intensifies legacy's value - the briefer the flame, the brighter it burns in memory.}
