\poem{Sorrow}{Sorrow = \frac{L \cdot T^2}{e^{-H} + R}}{\item $L$: \index{Loss}\textit{Loss}. The magnitude of what has been taken away or left behind, whether through death, separation, or the passage of time, amplifying the intensity of our grief.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration since the loss occurred, squared to show how sorrow can intensify before gradually diminishing, creating waves of grief that ebb and flow through seasons.
\item $H$: \index{Hope}\textit{Hope}. The flickering light of possibility and healing that exists within darkness, appearing as a negative exponent to show how even small amounts can exponentially reduce sorrow.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. The human spirit's remarkable ability to endure and recover from emotional wounds, acting as a foundation that prevents sorrow from becoming infinite or overwhelming.}{This equation reveals sorrow as loss amplified by time's complex relationship with grief, where initial intensity grows before healing begins. Hope appears as an exponential force of recovery, while resilience provides the steady foundation that prevents despair from consuming us entirely. The mathematics shows how human hearts process pain through both the acute multiplication of loss and time, and the gentle division of hope and inner strength.}
