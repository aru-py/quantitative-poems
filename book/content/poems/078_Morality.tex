\poem{Morality}{Morality = \frac{C \cdot \ln(E + 1) \cdot \sin(\theta)}{T^2}}{\item $C$: \index{Compassion}\textit{Compassion}. The capacity for deep empathy and understanding toward others' suffering, serving as the fundamental driving force behind ethical action and moral reasoning.
\item $E$: \index{Experience}\textit{Experience}. The accumulated wisdom from life's trials and encounters, which logarithmically enhances moral understanding through exposure to diverse perspectives and consequences.
\item $\theta$: \index{Perspective}\textit{Perspective}. The angle of one's worldview, representing how cultural background, education, and personal beliefs shape moral interpretation and ethical decision-making processes.
\item $T$: \index{Temptation}\textit{Temptation}. The gravitational pull of self-interest and immediate gratification that inversely affects moral clarity, growing stronger as moral resolve weakens through rationalization.}{This equation reveals morality as a delicate interplay of human virtues and weaknesses. Compassion provides the essential foundation, while experience grows our understanding logarithmicallyâ€”each lesson building upon the last. Our perspective oscillates like a sine wave, sometimes aligned with truth, sometimes clouded. Yet temptation squares its influence, creating an inverse relationship that can rapidly erode moral strength. True morality emerges when compassion and wisdom overcome the gravitational pull of selfish desires.}
