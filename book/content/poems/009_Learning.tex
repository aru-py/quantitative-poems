\poem{Learning}{Learning = \frac{C \cdot M^{\alpha} \cdot \ln(T+1)}{R + F}}{\item $C$: \index{Curiosity}\textit{Curiosity}. The burning flame of wonder that drives us to question, explore, and seek deeper truths beyond the surface of what we observe in our daily experiences.
\item $M$: \index{Motivation}\textit{Motivation}. The internal engine of purpose and drive that sustains our commitment to growth, even when faced with challenges, setbacks, and moments of intellectual struggle.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The precious currency of existence we invest in learning, where each moment of focused attention compounds into deeper understanding and mastery over our chosen domains.
\item $R$: \index{Resistance}\textit{Resistance}. The psychological barriers and mental blocks that arise from fear of failure, comfort zones, and cognitive biases that naturally oppose our expansion of knowledge.
\item $F$: \index{Fatigue}\textit{Fatigue}. The accumulated mental and emotional exhaustion that builds from sustained intellectual effort, creating diminishing returns in our capacity to absorb new information.}{This equation reveals learning as a dance between driving forces and limiting factors. Curiosity ignites the process, while motivation raised to power Î± amplifies our capacity exponentially. Time enters logarithmically, showing that learning accelerates initially but requires patience for deeper insights. The denominator captures how resistance and fatigue create friction, reminding us that true learning demands overcoming internal obstacles and managing our finite cognitive resources with wisdom.}
