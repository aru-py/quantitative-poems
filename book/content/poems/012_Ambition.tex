\poem{Ambition}{Ambition = \frac{V \cdot E^t}{R + S^2}}{\item $V$: \index{Vision}\textit{Vision}. The clarity and magnitude of one's dreams, acting as the guiding star that illuminates the path forward and provides direction for all ambitious endeavors.
\item $E$: \index{Effort}\textit{Effort}. The sustained energy and persistent action invested toward goals, exponentially growing over time as dedication compounds into transformative power.
\item $t$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The temporal dimension through which effort accumulates, representing the patient cultivation of skills and the gradual building of momentum toward achievement.
\item $R$: \index{Resistance}\textit{Resistance}. The external obstacles and societal barriers that stand in opposition to progress, creating friction that must be overcome through determination.
\item $S$: \index{SelfDoubt}\textit{SelfDoubt}. The internal voice of limitation and fear, squared to show its compounding negative effect as it grows stronger and more paralyzing over time.}{This equation reveals ambition as vision multiplied by effort raised to the power of time, divided by the combined forces that oppose us. Vision provides direction while effort compounds exponentially through persistent application over time. Yet ambition is tempered by resistance from the world and the squared effect of self-doubt, which grows more powerful as it festers. The mathematics shows that clear vision and sustained effort over time will overcome any obstacle, but only when we silence the voice that whispers we cannot achieve our dreams.}
