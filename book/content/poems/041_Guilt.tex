\poem{Guilt}{Guilt = \frac{M \cdot R^2 \cdot \ln(T)}{C + S}}{\item $M$: \index{Magnitude}\textit{Magnitude}. The perceived severity and moral weight of the transgression, amplifying guilt's intensity through the lens of personal values and societal standards.
\item $R$: \index{Responsibility}\textit{Responsibility}. The degree of personal accountability and control one feels over the action, exponentially increasing guilt when we believe we could have chosen differently.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration since the transgression occurred, with guilt growing logarithmically as memory crystallizes the weight of our choices into lasting regret.
\item $C$: \index{Compassion}\textit{Compassion}. Self-forgiveness and understanding that acts as a healing force, reducing guilt's grip through acceptance of human imperfection and growth potential.
\item $S$: \index{Support}\textit{Support}. External validation, forgiveness, and emotional assistance from others that helps diminish guilt's burden through shared understanding and connection.}{This equation reveals guilt as a complex emotional calculus where moral weight and personal responsibility compound exponentially, while time's logarithmic nature shows how guilt deepens slowly but persistently. The denominator represents our healing mechanisms - self-compassion and social support - that can diminish guilt's overwhelming power, suggesting that forgiveness, both internal and external, serves as the antidote to conscience's heaviest burdens.}
