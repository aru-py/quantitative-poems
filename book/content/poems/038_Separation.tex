\poem{Separation}{Separation = \frac{D \cdot T^2}{A \cdot e^{-C}}}{\item $D$: \index{Distance}\textit{Distance}. Physical or metaphorical space between people, encompassing geographic miles, communication gaps, and the growing void that emerges when lives diverge.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. Duration of disconnection raised to the second power, showing how separation intensifies exponentially as moments stretch into years of silence.
\item $A$: \index{Attachment}\textit{Attachment}. The strength of emotional bonds and shared memories that act as gravitational forces, pulling hearts together despite the forces trying to tear them apart.
\item $C$: \index{Communication}\textit{Communication}. The frequency and depth of meaningful exchanges that serve as bridges across the void, exponentially reducing separation when actively maintained.}{This equation reveals separation as a complex interplay of distance and time working against the healing forces of attachment and communication. Distance and time squared create an accelerating drift, while attachment acts as a constant anchor. The exponential term shows how even small acts of communication can dramatically heal the wounds of separation, suggesting that love's mathematics favor connection over division.}
