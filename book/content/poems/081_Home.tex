\poem{Home}{Home = \frac{M \cdot C^{\alpha}}{e^{-T/\tau} + D}}{\item $M$: \index{Memory}\textit{Memory}. The accumulated emotional experiences and meaningful moments that anchor us to place, creating invisible threads of connection that transform mere shelter into sacred space.
\item $C$: \index{Connection}\textit{Connection}. The depth of relationships and bonds formed within a space, encompassing family ties, friendship networks, and community roots that give meaning to our physical environment.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The duration of presence and investment in a place, where each passing moment deepens familiarity and transforms unfamiliar territory into cherished sanctuary through lived experience.
\item $D$: \index{Distance}\textit{Distance}. Physical and emotional separation from familiar places and people, representing the barriers of geography, circumstance, and change that can diminish our sense of belonging.}{This equation reveals home as an exponential relationship between memory and connection, moderated by time's healing power and challenged by distance. As memories multiply with meaningful connections, home grows exponentially. Time acts as a natural exponential decay that softens displacement, while distance in the denominator shows how separation weakens our sense of belonging. The mathematical poetry captures how home transcends mere location.}
