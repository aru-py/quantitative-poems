\poem{Eternity}{Eternity = \frac{M \cdot e^{L \cdot t}}{1 + \ln(F + 1)}}{\item $M$: \index{Meaning}\textit{Meaning}. The depth of purpose and significance found in experiences, relationships, and actions that transform fleeting moments into lasting impressions on the soul.
\item $L$: \index{Love}\textit{Love}. The intensity of emotional connection and devotion that amplifies the perception of time, making precious moments feel both instant and everlasting.
\item $t$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The actual duration of experiences measured in conventional units, which serves as the canvas upon which meaning and love paint their eternal impressions.
\item $F$: \index{Forgetting}\textit{Forgetting}. The natural human tendency to lose memories and details over time, which paradoxically both threatens and preserves the essence of eternal moments.}{This equation reveals how eternity emerges from the alchemy of human experience. Meaning multiplied by love's exponential growth over time creates moments that transcend mortality, while forgetting acts as a gentle logarithmic filter that preserves only the most precious essence. The mathematics shows that as meaning deepens and love intensifies, our perception of eternity grows exponentially, suggesting that infinity lives not in duration but in the depth of what we hold sacred.}
