\poem{Forgiveness}{Forgiveness = \frac{C \cdot T \cdot e^{-R}}{H + P^2}}{\item $C$: \index{Compassion}\textit{Compassion}. Deep empathy and understanding for human frailty, recognizing shared vulnerability and the universal nature of making mistakes in life's journey.
\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The healing passage of moments that softens sharp edges of hurt, allowing perspective to develop and emotional wounds to gradually transform into wisdom.
\item $R$: \index{Resentment}\textit{Resentment}. Accumulated bitterness and anger held toward the transgressor, which exponentially decays forgiveness when allowed to fester and consume the heart.
\item $H$: \index{Hurt}\textit{Hurt}. The depth of emotional pain inflicted by the original wound, creating resistance to forgiveness and serving as a barrier to healing and reconciliation.
\item $P$: \index{Pride}\textit{Pride}. Ego-driven resistance to vulnerability and admission of shared humanity, squared because pride compounds itself and creates exponential barriers to grace.}{This equation reveals forgiveness as a delicate alchemy where compassion and time work together, while resentment exponentially decays their power. The denominator shows how hurt and pride—especially pride squared—create formidable barriers. As we cultivate compassion and allow time's gentle passage, while consciously releasing resentment, forgiveness emerges like dawn breaking through darkness, transforming both forgiver and forgiven.}
