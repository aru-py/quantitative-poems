\poem{Conflict}{Conflict = \frac{T \cdot \Delta V^2}{R \cdot e^{-\alpha t}}}{\item $T$: \index{Tension}\textit{Tension}. The underlying stress and emotional charge that builds between parties, creating pressure that seeks release through confrontation or resolution.
\item $\Delta V$: \index{Values}\textit{Values}. The difference in core beliefs, principles, or worldviews between conflicting parties, where greater divergence amplifies the potential for discord.
\item $R$: \index{Respect}\textit{Respect}. The mutual regard and consideration shown between parties, acting as a stabilizing force that diminishes conflict intensity through understanding.
\item $\alpha$: \index{Wisdom}\textit{Wisdom}. The accumulated insight and emotional intelligence that grows with experience, helping to moderate conflicts through perspective and patience over time.}{This equation reveals conflict as an exponential dance between opposing forces. Tension multiplies with the square of value differences, creating volatile potential energy. Yet respect acts as a denominator, grounding the discord, while wisdom's exponential decay over time shows how maturity naturally dissolves conflicts. The mathematics mirrors life: sharp disagreements intensify quickly, but patient understanding and mutual respect transform even the deepest divisions into opportunities for growth and connection.}
