\poem{Compassion}{Compassion = \frac{E \cdot U^2 \cdot \ln(S+1)}{P + R}}{\item $E$: \index{Empathy}\textit{Empathy}. The ability to deeply understand and share the feelings of another person, serving as the foundational emotional bridge that connects hearts across experiences.
\item $U$: \index{Understanding}\textit{Understanding}. The cognitive and emotional comprehension of another's circumstances, squared to emphasize how deeper insight exponentially amplifies compassionate response.
\item $S$: \index{Suffering}\textit{Suffering}. The pain, hardship, or distress witnessed in others, where the logarithmic function reflects how compassion grows with awareness of even small amounts of pain.
\item $P$: \index{Prejudice}\textit{Prejudice}. Preconceived judgments and biases that create barriers to seeing others' humanity, acting as a divisive force that diminishes our capacity for genuine care.
\item $R$: \index{Resentment}\textit{Resentment}. Accumulated hurt and bitterness from past experiences that hardens the heart, creating emotional walls that prevent the free flow of compassionate feeling.}{This equation reveals compassion as empathy multiplied by the square of understanding, enhanced by our logarithmic awareness of suffering, yet constrained by the barriers of prejudice and resentment. Like light bending through a prism, our capacity for compassion refracts through the lens of our own emotional wisdom, growing exponentially as we truly comprehend another's experience while being tempered by the shadows of our own unhealed wounds and unconscious biases.}
