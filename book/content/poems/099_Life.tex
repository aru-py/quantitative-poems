\poem{Life}{Life = \frac{P \cdot e^{Et}}{S + \ln(C)}}{\item $P$: \index{Purpose}\textit{Purpose}. The driving force that gives meaning to our actions and decisions, acting as a multiplier that amplifies the significance of our existence and experiences.
\item $E$: \index{Experience}\textit{Experience}. The accumulated wisdom and knowledge gained through living, which exponentially enhances our capacity to appreciate and understand life's complexities.
\item $t$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The continuous flow of moments that shapes our journey, allowing experiences to compound and deepen our understanding of existence through duration.
\item $S$: \index{Suffering}\textit{Suffering}. The inevitable challenges and pain we encounter, which paradoxically can diminish life's perceived value while also serving as a catalyst for growth and resilience.
\item $C$: \index{Comfort}\textit{Comfort}. The state of ease and security that, while providing stability, can logarithmically reduce life's intensity and our motivation to seek meaningful experiences.}{This equation reveals life as an exponential dance between purpose and time, where experiences compound like interest in the vault of memory. Purpose multiplies our existence, while time allows wisdom to grow exponentially. Yet suffering and comfort form life's denominators - suffering can overwhelm us, while excessive comfort logarithmically dampens our drive for growth, creating the delicate balance that defines human existence.}
