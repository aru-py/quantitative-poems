\poem{Tragedy}{Tragedy = \frac{H \cdot \ln(P + 1)}{R^2} \cdot e^{-t/\tau}}{\item $H$: \index{Hope}\textit{Hope}. The luminous expectations and dreams we carry, making tragedy more devastating as higher hopes create greater falls when shattered by reality's harsh truths.
\item $P$: \index{Potential}\textit{Potential}. The unrealized possibilities and futures that could have been, whose logarithmic growth amplifies our sense of loss when tragedy cuts short what might have flourished.
\item $R$: \index{Resilience}\textit{Resilience}. Our inner strength and capacity to withstand life's storms, appearing squared in the denominator as stronger resilience dramatically reduces tragedy's impact on our souls.
\item $t$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The relentless passage of moments since the tragic event occurred, serving as the variable in the exponential decay that gradually diminishes tragedy's acute sting.
\item $\tau$: \index{Healing}\textit{Healing}. The characteristic time constant representing our personal capacity for emotional recovery, determining how quickly the exponential healing process unfolds within us.}{This equation reveals tragedy as hope's cruel mathematics - where greater dreams amplify our fall through logarithmic potential, while resilience squared in the denominator shows how inner strength dramatically shields us. Time's exponential decay offers redemption, as even the deepest wounds fade according to our healing constant, proving that human hearts, though broken, possess infinite capacity for renewal.}
