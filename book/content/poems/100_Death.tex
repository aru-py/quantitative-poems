\poem{Death}{Death = \frac{T \cdot e^{-M}}{L \cdot \sin(\theta)}}{\item $T$: \index{Time}\textit{Time}. The relentless forward march of moments that accumulates entropy and wear upon our physical forms, serving as the primary driver of mortality's approach.
\item $M$: \index{Meaning}\textit{Meaning}. The depth of purpose and significance we cultivate in our lives, which exponentially diminishes death's psychological weight through legacy and fulfillment.
\item $L$: \index{Love}\textit{Love}. The profound connections and bonds we forge with others, creating a protective force that gives us reason to persist and fight against mortality's pull.
\item $\theta$: \index{Hope}\textit{Hope}. The angle of optimism and faith we maintain toward the future, where greater hope creates stronger resistance against death's inevitability through resilience.}{This equation reveals death as time's inexorable advance, exponentially softened by the meaning we create. Love acts as a protective denominator, while hope's sine function shows that even small angles of optimism can provide profound resistance. When meaning flourishes and love deepens, death loses its sting, becoming not an end but a natural completion of a life well-lived.}
