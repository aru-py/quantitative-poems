\poem{War}{War = \frac{P^2 \cdot R \cdot e^{I}}{T + H}}{\item $P$: \index{Power}\textit{Power}. The desire for dominance and control over resources, territory, or ideology, squared to show how power-seeking amplifies exponentially in competitive situations.
\item $R$: \index{Resources}\textit{Resources}. Scarcity of essential materials, land, or wealth that drives competition between groups, acting as a multiplier that intensifies conflicts over survival and prosperity.
\item $I$: \index{Ideology}\textit{Ideology}. Fundamental beliefs and worldviews that create irreconcilable differences, exponentially escalating conflicts when groups view their values as absolute and non-negotiable.
\item $T$: \index{Trust}\textit{Trust}. The foundation of diplomatic relations and peaceful coexistence, serving as a denominator that reduces conflict potential when present between opposing parties.
\item $H$: \index{Humanity}\textit{Humanity}. Compassion, empathy, and recognition of shared human dignity that acts as a restraining force against violence, diminishing war's likelihood through moral consideration.}{This equation reveals war as the tragic result when human ambitions collide with scarcity while moral restraints weaken. Power-seeking squared with resource competition, amplified exponentially by ideological fervor, creates devastating conflict. Yet trust and humanity serve as denominatorsâ€”the greater our capacity for empathy and diplomatic faith, the more we can contain war's destructive potential and choose peace over violence.}
