\poem{Trust}{Trust = \frac{R \cdot I^2 \cdot \ln(C+1)}{V + B}}{\item $R$: \index{Reliability}\textit{Reliability}. The consistent demonstration of dependability through actions over time, forming the bedrock upon which trust is built through repeated positive experiences.
\item $I$: \index{Intimacy}\textit{Intimacy}. The depth of emotional closeness and shared vulnerability between individuals, exponentially amplifying trust through genuine understanding and acceptance.
\item $C$: \index{Communication}\textit{Communication}. The quality and openness of dialogue between people, logarithmically enhancing trust as honest expression creates deeper understanding and connection.
\item $V$: \index{Vulnerability}\textit{Vulnerability}. The perceived risk of emotional harm when opening oneself to another, acting as a natural barrier that must be overcome for trust to flourish fully.
\item $B$: \index{Betrayal}\textit{Betrayal}. The accumulated weight of past disappointments and broken promises that create protective walls, diminishing our capacity to trust completely.}{This equation reveals trust as an intricate dance between connection and protection. Reliability provides the foundation, while intimacy squares its impact, showing how emotional closeness exponentially deepens trust. Communication grows logarithmically, reflecting how each honest conversation builds understanding. Yet vulnerability and betrayal form denominators - the fears and wounds that guard our hearts, requiring courage to overcome for trust to reach its full transformative power.}
